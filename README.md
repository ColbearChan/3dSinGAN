# 3dSinGAN

Abstract
Generative Adversarial Nets have been a big hit on data reconstruction, especially with 2 dimensional images. However, there are not as much research in 3 dimensional models reconstruction, particularly GANs that learn the distribution from a single model. In this research, two types of approaches called Flat-point GAN and Single-point GAN, are proposed for generating variations basing on a single ground truth 3 dimensional model, and proved that GAN type network can be one of the solutions to improve the efficiency of the crafted product manufacture process. The result shows that one of the approaches is able to generate variations that meet the requirements with the support of random latent space, while the other one failed to generate potentially due to the characteristics of the dataset and the wrong choice of loss metric. This paper further discussed the other methods that can improve the proposed networks.
